\page apdx_datetime Datetime formats


OpenFLUID uses the ANSI strftime() standard formats for date time formatting to and from a format string.
As an example, this format string can be used in CSV observer in parameters to customize date formats.\n
The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and ordinary characters.
A conversion specification consists of a \% character and a terminating conversion character that determines the conversion specification's behaviour.
All ordinary characters are copied unchanged into the array.

For example, the nineteenth of April, two-thousand seven, at eleven hours, ten minutes and twenty-five seconds formatted using different format strings:
<ul>
<li><tt>\%d/\%m/\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S</tt> will give <tt>19/04/2007 10:11:25</tt>
<li><tt>\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H.\%M</tt> will give <tt>2007-04-19 10.11</tt>
<li><tt>\%Y\\t\%m\\t\%d\\t\%H\\t\%M\\t\%S</tt> will give <tt>2007 04  19  10  11  25</tt>
</ul>

  <li>\%a : locale's abbreviated weekday name. 
  <li>\%A : locale's full weekday name.
